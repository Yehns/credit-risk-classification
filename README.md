# credit-risk-classification
Module 20

Various machine learning techniques will be used to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. A dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company will be used to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. These criteria include income, debt, and loan size.
